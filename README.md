## 🌟 Inspiration

This idea was inspired by **Pranam Srivastava**, our visually impaired teammate, former AI Intern at Infosys, and AI/ML Lead at GDG IIIT Kota. Despite his exceptional coding and AI skills, he faces major hurdles in accessing job platforms and training resources due to accessibility gaps. His journey and challenges made us realize how important inclusive digital solutions are for millions of PwDs.
